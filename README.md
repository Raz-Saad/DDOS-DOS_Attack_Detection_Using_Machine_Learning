## Abstract
This project focuses on enhancing the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. Building upon previous work, we explored various algorithms and expanded the dataset to improve detection accuracy.

## Introduction
DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to internet security, leading to financial losses and service disruptions. By implementing a robust detection system, organizations can better protect their networks from malicious traffic. This project builds on methods from the paper "DDOS Attack Identification using Machine Learning Techniques," adding improvements and additional data for more effective detection.

## Achieved Contributions
1. Verified and improved the original paper's methods and results.
2. Experimented with different models and feature selection techniques.
3. Expanded the dataset to include additional relevant data, enhancing model training and performance.

## Dataset
We used the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, specifically focusing on the "Wednesday workingHours" and "Friday WorkingHours Afternoon DDos" files. The dataset includes 78 features and a class label, with a total of 917,117 records after expansion.
